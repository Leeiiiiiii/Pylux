# AGPL Compliance - Source Code Distribution

## Overview

pylux is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0). This license requires that when distributing binary versions, you must provide access to the corresponding source code.

## How It Works

### 1. Automated Source Code Upload (GitHub Action)

The GitHub Action `.github/workflows/upload-source-code.yml` automatically:
- Creates a complete source code archive when code is pushed
- Uploads it to Dropbox under `/pylux-sources/`
- Runs on:
  - Manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)
  - Push to main/master branches
  - Push to release branches
  - Version tags

### 2. License Files in Binary Distribution

Build scripts use the helper function `add_agpl_compliance()` from `scripts/add-agpl-compliance.sh` to add:
- **`usr/share/licenses/pylux/COPYING`**: Full AGPL-3.0 license text
- **`usr/share/licenses/pylux/SOURCE_CODE.txt`**: Notice with link to download source code

Files are placed in `usr/share/licenses/pylux/` to follow Linux standards while being less prominent to end users.

### 3. Reusable Helper Script

The template `legal/agpl-source-notice.txt` contains the notice text with placeholders that are replaced at build time:
- `__BUILD_DATE__` → Build timestamp
- `__GIT_COMMIT__` → Git commit hash
- `__GIT_BRANCH__` → Git branch name
- `__ARCHITECTURE__` → System architecture

## Setup for GitHub Action

### Required Secrets

Set these in your repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

- `DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN`
- `DROPBOX_APP_KEY`
- `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET`

### Getting Dropbox OAuth Credentials

1. Go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
2. Click "Create app"
3. Choose:
   - **API**: Scoped access
   - **Access**: Full Dropbox
   - **Name**: e.g., "chiaki-ng-source-hosting"
4. In the **Permissions** tab, enable:
   - `files.content.write`
   - `files.content.read`
   - `sharing.write`
5. In the **Settings** tab:
   - Note your **App key** and **App secret**
   - Generate an **Access token** (this is the refresh token)

## Using in Build Scripts

To add AGPL compliance to any build script:

```bash
# Source the helper script
source scripts/add-agpl-compliance.sh

# Call the function with your distribution directory
add_agpl_compliance "/path/to/distribution/root"
```

**Example** (as used in `build-appimage.sh`):
```bash
cd ..
source scripts/add-agpl-compliance.sh
add_agpl_compliance "appimage/${PORTABLE_DIR}"
cd appimage
```

This will automatically:
- Create `usr/share/licenses/pylux/` directory
- Copy `COPYING` license file
- Generate `SOURCE_CODE.txt` with build information

## Updating the Source Code Link

The source code is uploaded with a **static filename** (`pylux-source-latest.tar.gz`) that gets overwritten on each upload, so the Dropbox link never changes.

### One-Time Setup:

1. Run the GitHub Action once (manually via workflow_dispatch)
2. Check Dropbox `/pylux-sources/pylux-source-latest.tar.gz`
3. Get the shared link for the file (Right-click → Share → Create link)
4. Update line 11 in `legal/agpl-source-notice.txt` with the actual URL

Example:
```
    https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/abc123xyz/pylux-source-latest.tar.gz?rlkey=xyz&dl=1
```

**Important:** Make sure the link ends with `?dl=1` (or `&dl=1`) for direct download.

Since the filename is static, you only need to set this URL once. Future builds will automatically overwrite the same file in Dropbox, so the link continues to work.

## Manual Source Distribution (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use Dropbox, you can:

1. Manually create source archives when releasing binaries
2. Upload to GitHub Releases, your own server, or any public hosting
3. Update the URL in `scripts/build-appimage.sh` line 131

## AGPL Compliance Requirements

✅ **What we do:**
- Include full license text (COPYING)
- Provide written offer to source code (SOURCE_CODE.txt)
- Make source available via public download link
- Include all source needed to build the software

✅ **AGPL Section 6(d) compliance:**
> "Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place...
> and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way"

This means providing a download link in the binary distribution is sufficient.

## Important Notes

### Source Retention
- Keep source archives available as long as you distribute the binary
- AGPL doesn't specify a duration, but 3+ years is recommended

### What's Included in Source Archive
- All source code files
- Build scripts and configuration
- Third-party dependencies (submodules)
- Documentation
- Excludes: build artifacts, binaries, .git history

### Modified Versions
If you modify and distribute the software:
1. Include your modifications in the source archive
2. Add prominent notices of your changes
3. Update the source code link in SOURCE_CODE.txt
4. Maintain the same AGPL license

## Verification

After building, check that the files exist in the distribution:
```bash
ls pylux/usr/share/licenses/pylux/COPYING        # License file exists
ls pylux/usr/share/licenses/pylux/SOURCE_CODE.txt # Source info exists
cat pylux/usr/share/licenses/pylux/SOURCE_CODE.txt # URL is correct
```

The files are intentionally placed in a standard but less prominent location (`usr/share/licenses/pylux/`) to comply with AGPL while not being immediately visible to end users.
